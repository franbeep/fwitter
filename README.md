  Sample website for testing NextJS & other things

<h2>About</h2>

<h3>Still in development!</h3>

<p>
  You have come across a sample website. Fwitter is a "not yet" functional twitter-like app. I have decided to create it to see how I would create twitter, or at least its appearance. Since there was a few things I wanted to test out, namely speaking NextJS, I tried to use it here, though it still very raw and not using next to its full capacity.

<h2>Features</h2>

- NextJS for SSG and serverless functions
- Firebase for file and data hosting
- Rxjs for async event development
- Material UI

<h3>Thanks!</h3>
